# Email Encryption and Decryption App

This Python application allows users to send encrypted emails via Gmail, using various encryption algorithms (AES, DES, TripleDES, Blowfish). It also provides a decryption feature for retrieving encrypted email messages.

## Features

- **Gmail Integration**: Send encrypted emails using your Gmail account.
- **Encryption Algorithms**: Supports AES, DES, TripleDES, and Blowfish for encrypting the email body.
- **Email Decryption**: Decrypt previously encrypted email messages.
- **User Interface**: Built using `Tkinter` for an interactive and user-friendly GUI.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, you need to set up the following dependencies:

1. **Google API**: Set up your project on the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), enable Gmail API, and download the credentials file (`client_secret.json`).
2. **Python Packages**: Install the required Python libraries:
   - `google-auth`
   - `google-auth-oauthlib`
   - `google-api-python-client`
   - `cryptography`
   - `tkinter`

You can install the required packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client cryptography
```

## Setup

1. **Google API Credentials**: 
   - Download your `client_secret.json` from Google Cloud.
   - Replace the `CREDENTIALS_FILE` variable in the code with the path to your credentials file.

2. **Running the Application**:
   - Clone or download the repository.
   - Open a terminal and run the following command to start the application:
     ```bash
     python email_encryption_app.py
     ```

3. **Gmail Authorization**:
   - When you run the app for the first time, click the "Authorize Gmail" button to authenticate your Gmail account with the application.

## How to Use

### Encrypt an Email:
1. **Authorize Gmail**: Click "Authorize Gmail" to authorize the app to access your Gmail account.
2. **Enter Email Details**:
   - Provide the recipient's email address.
   - Enter the subject and body of the email.
   - Choose the desired encryption algorithm (AES, DES, TripleDES, or Blowfish).
3. **Send Encrypted Email**: Click "Send Encrypted Email" to send the encrypted email.

### Decrypt a Message:
1. **Enter Encrypted Message**: Paste the encrypted message in the "Encrypted Message" field.
2. **Enter Encryption Key**: Provide the encryption key used during the email encryption.
3. **Choose Algorithm**: Select the encryption algorithm that was used.
4. **Decrypt**: Click "Decrypt" to view the decrypted message.

## Encryption Algorithms

The following encryption algorithms are supported:

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: A symmetric encryption algorithm that is widely used for secure data encryption.
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: A symmetric-key algorithm that is older but still widely used for various encryption applications.
- **TripleDES**: An enhancement to DES that applies the DES algorithm three times to each data block.
- **Blowfish**: A fast block cipher designed to replace DES.

## Code Structure

- **EmailEncryptionApp**: Main class that manages the GUI and handles email encryption and decryption.
- **encrypt_content**: Encrypts the email body using the selected encryption algorithm.
- **send_email**: Sends the encrypted email using Gmail API.
- **decrypt_message**: Decrypts an encrypted message based on the provided key and algorithm.
- **authorize_gmail**: Authorizes Gmail API access for the app.
